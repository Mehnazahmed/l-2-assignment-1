The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union Types:  
Union types allow a variable to have multiple types. They are denoted using the | operator between the types.
Example: 
let param1: string | number;

Significance:
1.Flexibility: Union types offer flexibility by allowing variables to hold values of different types.
2.Error Prevention: They aid in preventing runtime errors through type checks by the TypeScript compiler.
3.Handling Different Scenarios: Useful when dealing with functions or variables that can accept various types of values.
4.API Flexibility: Particularly beneficial when working with APIs that may return different data types.


Intersection Types:
Intersection types combine multiple types into one, represented using the & operator between the types.

Example:
interface A {
    param1: number;
}

interface B {
    param2: string;
}

type AB = A & B;

Significance:
1.Combining Types: Intersection types combine properties from multiple types into a single type, resulting in an object that possesses all properties.
2.Code Reusability: They encourage code reusability by composing types without requiring inheritance.
3.Flexible Composition: Valuable for creating complex objects satisfying multiple conditions or constraints.
4.Expressive Typing: Facilitates the expression of intricate type relationships, leading to more comprehensible code.
